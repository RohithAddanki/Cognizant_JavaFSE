Big O Notation is used to describe the performance (time or space) of an algorithm as input size grows.
- O(1): Constant time
- O(n): Linear time
- O(log n): Logarithmic time
- O(n log n), O(n^2), etc.

For Searching:
- Linear Search: Best O(1), Avg O(n), Worst O(n)
- Binary Search: Best O(1), Avg/Worst O(log n), requires sorted data
