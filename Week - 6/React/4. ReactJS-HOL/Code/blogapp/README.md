This is a React class-based application that demonstrates how to use **lifecycle methods** such as `componentDidMount()` and `componentDidCatch()` while rendering a list of blog posts using custom data.

Getting Started with React
React is a powerful JavaScript library used to build user interfaces. This blog explains the basics of setting up a React project.

Understanding Props and State
In React, props allow data to be passed from parent to child, while state manages internal component data.

React Lifecycle Methods
React class components go through lifecycle stages. componentDidMount is used for data fetching and initialization.

Handling Errors with componentDidCatch
componentDidCatch is a lifecycle hook used to catch runtime rendering errors and gracefully display fallback UI.
